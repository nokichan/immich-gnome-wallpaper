# Immich Wallpaper v1.3 - Immich 3.0 Compatibility

## Bug Fixes

- **Immich 3.0 API compatibility**: Migrated from deprecated `GET /api/assets/random` to `POST /api/search/random` endpoint, fixing photo fetching on Immich server 3.0+

## Technical Improvements

- Album filtering now uses `albumIds` in the request body instead of a separate API endpoint

---

# Immich Wallpaper v1.2 - Async File Operations

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Async file reading**: Changed from synchronous `load_contents()` to asynchronous `load_contents_async()` for loading the current index file, improving performance and preventing blocking in the GNOME Shell process

# Immich Wallpaper v1.1 - Random Selection & Persistence

## 🎲 New Features (thanks [inktveer](https://github.com/inktveer) !)

- **True random wallpaper selection**: Photos are now selected randomly instead of sequentially 
- **Persistent index**: The current photo index is now saved to disk, preventing reset after system suspend/resume

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed wallpaper rotation always following the same sequential order
- Fixed index reset issue when system enters sleep mode
- Added proper validation when photo list is updated

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

- Index is now stored in `~/.cache/immich-wallpaper/current-index`
- Added `_validateCurrentIndex()` method for range checking
